# Mastermind Game Project

This is a classic game from the '80 that I remade in HTML and JS.

## Instructions

At the beginning of the game, the computer geneterates a sequence of 4 colors taken from a palette of 3, 4 or 5, depending on the difficulty level. By clicking the buttons below the board, the player chooses his colors among the given palette and tries to match the computer's sequence. 

### Visual aids

Every time the player chooses 4 colors a row ends and a **visual hint** is given. White dot means the player guessed the right color in the right position, while black dot means the playes guessed the right color but in the wrong position.

### Difficulty level

There are **3 difficulty level**, which affect the number of colors composing the sequence. The easy level has just 3 colors, the normal level has 4 colors, the hard level has 5 colors.

### Reset

There is a **reset** button on the right side of the top area of the screen. Whenever you press it, the game will restart and all data will reset.


## End of game

The game ends either guessing the right sequence or finishing your attempts. There's also a time limit of **666 seconds**, but you better not reaching it or something really **evil** will happen.
